#Coin Sort
I wrote this program as a Junior in High School (if I recall correctly) to run a "coin sorting robot". It was compiled and flashed to a PIC16F874A. My uncle Jonathan helped me with the wiring and other electronics. The robot was mostly made of wood. It had 3 motors that closed the "hand", lifted, and rotated the arm. It worked flawlessly. I miss it.

Anyhow, I recently found a printout of the code and have transcribed it here. I tried to copy it exactly as it was originally written (except a few spelling errors in comments). Compared to my ability now, it's just awful. Still, I'm proud of it. It took a lot of determination to figure out everything. Mostly it was just challenging because there were no integer operations and there was no output. If something went wrong I just had to read the assembly and try to see what it was doing.

Just for fun, here are some facts about the PIC16:

- 20MHz Operating Frequency
- 4000 14-bit Words of Flash Program Memory
- 192 Bytes of Memory
- 35 Total Opcodes (13 Control Ops, 4 Bit Ops, and 18 Byte Ops)
- No integer operations
